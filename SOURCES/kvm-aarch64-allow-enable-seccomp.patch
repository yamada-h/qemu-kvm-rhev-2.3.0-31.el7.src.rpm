RHEL-only

This is a few character patch that needs a long commit message
to explain why it's downstream only. So, here we go...

Once upon a time arm and aarch64 builds were allowed to use
--enable-seccomp, but a problem with arm builds resulted in
upstream commit ae6e8ef11e6c: "Revert seccomp tests that allow
it to be used on non-x86 architectures". Now, the only way to
revert that revert is to get the seccomp whitelist working
for all architectures that have libseccomp, which means arm,
aarch64, and even mips and mips64 (but nobody mentioned mips
upstream yet, so shh...) For arm, we needed to patch libseccomp
and qemu to get things working. That's done now, but it'll be
a while before we have upstream commit hashes to reference, and,
even if we did, RHELSA wouldn't have a late enough libseccomp in
its compose to pass the atleast-version test in qemu's configure,
since that version will be bumped to the one containing the
libseccomp patch for arm, thus we'd need a downstream-only patch
anyway.

Now, we want to turn libseccomp on for the obvious security reasons,
and also because the sooner we run with it on, the sooner we'll find
bugs with it on.

Oh, and we actually don't have to worry about the atleast-version,
which is currently is in configure, even though it's old. This is
because this patch is for building RHELSA's qemu-kvm-rhev, which is
only for RHELSA, and the earliest libseccomp version installable on
RHELSA is late enough.

The end.
